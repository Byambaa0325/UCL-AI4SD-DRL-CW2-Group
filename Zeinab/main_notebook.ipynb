    "## Description\n",
    "For this coursework, you are required to develop a behaviour cloning model. Behaviour cloning is a technique for training robotic agents using a dataset of sequences of actions. Consider the supervised learning definition where we have a dataset of observatios $d=\\{(x_{1},y_{1}),...,(x_{n},y_{n})\\}$ and the aim is to learn a function: $f:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}$. In this case, $\\mathcal{X}$ is the set of \"observations\" that the robot makes and $\\mathcal{Y}$ is the set of actions that the robot takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you have been provided with contains examples of robot arms being required to pickup objects or drop objects (given it has already picked the object up) in a specific place. The observation space ($\\mathcal{X}$) consists of:\n",
    "- \"front_cam_ob\": A 3rd person image of the scene \n",
    "- \"mount_cam_ob\": An image of the scene taken from a camera mounted on top of the robotic arm, looking down\n",
    "- \"ee_cartesian_pos_ob\": The positional and orientation co-ordinates of the robotic arm\n",
    "- \"ee_cartesian_vel_ob\": The velocity of position and orientation of the robotic arm\n",
    "- \"joint_pos_ob\": The position of the gripper which opens and closes\n",
    "\n",
    "The action space ($\\mathcal{Y}$) consists of:\n",
    "- Three co-ordinates defining how much to move the robotic arm\n",
    "- An action defining whether to open, not to move or close the gripper\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split into \"trajectories\" i.e., sequences of:\n",
    "- $x_{i}$: The front_cam_ob, mount_cam_ob, ee_cartesian_pos_ob, ee_cartesian_vel_ob, joint_pos_ob __at time point i__ \n",
    "- $y_{i}$: The action taken i.e., how to move the arm and the gripper __given the observations__ in $x_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on the dataset can be found at: https://github.com/clvrai/clvr_jaco_play_dataset?tab=readme-ov-file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Your task has been split into several questions, each exploring how to develop an appropriate model for learning $f:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}$. The task will require you to:\n",
    "- Question 1: Tune an end-to-end supervised learning model taking in the full set of observations and predicting actions: You will be required to evaluate a proposed deep learning architecture (which takes as input all of front_cam_ob, mount_cam_ob, ee_cartesian_pos_ob, ee_cartesian_vel_ob and joint_pos_ob and predict the two actions) and propose a new model which outperforms the existing model;\n",
    "- Question 2: Define and evaluate a VAE model for performing self-supervised learning and tune it as best you can, to learn a latent representation that can be used as input to a downstream supervised model for behaviour cloning\n",
    "- Question 3: Evaluate the performance of your model proposed in question 1 against your self-supervised VAE representations from question 2 (plus a supervised head) on the test set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pointers\n",
    "Some helper functions have been provided for you including the following functionality:\n",
    "- A training and validation loop capabale of:\n",
    "  - Handling \"half-precision\" modelling;\n",
    "  - Logging results to weights and biases;\n",
    "- An eda template to help you visualise the data\n",
    "- An evaluation template to help you load saved model checkpoints from weights and biases\n",
    "- A preprocessing script to help you convert the data into train/validation and test splits;\n",
    "  - In this preprocessing script, trajectories longer than 75 timesteps have been removed to ease the computational requirements of the task;\n",
    "- A torch Dataset class capable of handling the multi-model nature of the data;\n",
    "- A example collate_fn to use in Dataloaders\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is strongly suggested to call ```torch.manual_seed(1)``` whenever you initialise your model (i.e., when you first create the model or call model.reset()). This will ensure the parameters are initialised at the same value each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT\n",
    "- You are __not__ allowed to use pre-trained models, developed outside of this coursework i.e., you could __not__ use a pre-trained YOLO model\n",
    "- Questions have been marked under the title \"Task\", ensure that you answer/address all of the bullet points under these headings\n",
    "- Pls add proper citations or references where necessary in your justification\n",
    "- You can use markdown language to add formatting to your text. A cheatsheet is found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\n",
    "- The completed assignment jupyter notebook (With Python code and English Text) should have all the output cells been executed and solution outputs are visible"
